Seems we will be using the pigpio library: http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/python.html
It seems it has a lot of setting for PWM but not as much for PPM.

The joystick repo writes PPM signals, it seems doable, so I'll analyse that later.
This is the library: https://github.com/jsa/flystick

Reading PPM: https://www.thingsjar.com/blog/2019/01/13/How-to-use-PPM-signal-to-control-your-RC-car-with-a-raspberry-pi/
Will need to go through that article and try and understand how they are reading it.
